Description: Generate and manipulate tree plots. Predefined tree structures can 
    be plotted, or random structures can be generated. Trees can be pruned to 
    remove one or more tiers of outer branches, and symbols can be plotted at 
    specified or randomly chosen coordinates along branches. Trees can be 
    plotted to represent hierarchical structures (e.g. dendrograms), or can 
    mimic trees (the things with trunks, branches and leaves) in nature.
