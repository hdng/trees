Description: Generate and manipulate tree plots. Predefined tree structures can
    be plotted, or random structures can be generated. Trees can be pruned to
    remove one or more tiers of outer branches, and symbols can be plotted at
    specified or randomly chosen coordinates along branches. Trees can be
    plotted to represent hierarchical structures (e.g. dendrograms), or can
    mimic trees (the things with trunks, branches and leaves) in nature.
    This package is adopt by Ha Dang to use in tree plotting of ClonEvol package
